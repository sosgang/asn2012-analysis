# Output Data

This folder contains the results of the analyses and experiments presented in the paper titled "Predicting the Results of Evaluation Procedures of Academics".

In particular:
* __RFs-Level1.csv__ and __RFs-Level2.csv__ contain the results of the analysis of the Recruitment Fields (RFs). The files report the performances of the SVM algorithm using 291 predictors for academic level I (Full Professor) and II (Associate Professor), respectively. 
* __Areas_Level1.csv__ and __Areas_Level2.csv__ contain the results of the analysis of the Scientific Areas (SAs). The files report the performances of the SVM algorithm using 291 predictors for academic level I (Full Professor) and II (Associate Professor), respectively. 
* __FeatureSel-Level1.csv__ and __FeatureSel-Level2.csv__ contain the results of the analysis of the Recruitment Fields using the top 15 predictors. The files report the performances of the SVM algorithm using 291 predictors for academic level I (Full Professor) and II (Associate Professor), respectively.
* ___Experiment1.csv__ and __Experiment1.csv__ contain the results of experiment #1 (i.e. comparison with Jensen's models) and experiment #2 (i.e. comparison with Tregella's models), respectively.
